Reign Of Heroes MMORPG Storyline

GamingStudioX, Xephos and Random_Wookie, please complete the storyline and add your ideas please.

 - Guide: 'Hero! You are here! Our greatest archmages have summoned you successfully this time! You are needed to save the Kingdom from destruction!'
 - Guide: '(IGN)! You have been summoned by the 8 archmages in our Kingdom! You have a very important role here! Sepulchure The Dark Lord has risen once again! You are the outcome of 3 years of hard work! You have the ability to learn skills many could not, and have much powerful magic!
 - Hero: 'I don't understand, who am I? And what am I doing here?'

 - Guardian: 'Hero! You are here! The Knight Class forms the soldiers the Kingdom use for offensive and defensive purposes, we are armored, tough and have a heavy sword as our weapon. Our style of combat is to take heavy damage while units with less defence attack the opponent!'
 - Archmage: 'Hope the arcane forces be in your favour! The Sorcerers, Wizards, Mages, or whatever you call us. Our speciality is the arcane, the most volatile and powerful force in the universe! We can use powerful spells, from fireballs to teleporting to destroying an entire village!'
 - Assassin: 'Greeting (IGN), we are the Rogues. Stealth is our speciality, and doing the killing blow on our opponents is our weapon. We are the Kingdom's secret weapon, although we raid travellers occasionally, our job is to help the Kingdom alter the history and the Kingdom's fate!'
 - Hero selects his class from commands given by trainers.

 - Hero goes to Southern Ravenwood and found the Royal Guardian trapped on his horse by a group of Undead Zombies and Undead Archers.
 - Hero takes out the undead and talks to Guardian.

 - Hero is rewarded some EXP, Gold, and a good class specific weapon.
 - After exploring a while, Hero meets the Royal Guardian outside the gate.
 - Royal Guardian: Hero! I need your help once again. There is a group of Undead Knights attacking and raiding Dragonshire! Report there immediately!
 - Hero goes to Dragonshire to defeat enemies
 - Villager: Hey you! I'm so glad you're here, the Undead Knights have done critical damage to Dragonshire! Please, stop them before they can get any farther!
 - Hero defeats all Undead Knights
 - Villager: Oh, thank you, without you, Dragonshire would surely have perished! Here, take this as a small gift! Talk to me again when you are ready.
 - Hero recieves some Gold
 - Hero talks to Villager
 - Villager: Wow, those Undead Knights sure did a lot of damage to the town. Dragonshire is almost destroyed. Here, take this letter to the Royal Guardian inform him of the condition of the town.
 - Hero recieves letter
 - Hero takes letter to Royal Guardian
 - Royal Guardian: Hmm...I see. Dragonshire will need some protection along with some new supplies, I need you to protect a group of slaves and some knights to Dragonshire and return to me immediately.
 - Hero goes to the group in Dragonshire
 - Villager: You have returned so quickly? Ah, you are helping out our reinforcements, good. Thank you so much for your help, if you need anything, ask me! Hey, why don't you go explore the forest west of the town, there have been some strange sightings there...
 - Hero goes to explore the Forest
 - Hero sees a huge group of Undead Knights, Undead Zombies and Undead Archers not too far from the town! He must report this back to the Villager!
 - Hero talks to the Villager again
 - Villager: What?! Undeads? In the - the - the forest? Please! Send word to the Royal Guardian immediately!
 - Hero talks to the Royal Guardian
 - Royal Guardian: Again? Oh, more trouble in the Dragonshire town? Hm. What? Undeads in the forest near the town? This is strange, the Undeads usually reside in graveyards far from the Kingdom...I can't tell what this means, go ask the Headmaster of Magic at his school.
 - Hero goes goes to Headmaster of Magic and relays the Royal Guardian's words
 - Headmaster of Magic: Really? That's absurd...but now that I think of it, things have been a bit different...The temperature has risen and the animals are also acting out of the ordinary...give me some time to think about this, I'm not sure what's going on...
 - After some amount of time, Hero returns to the Headmaster of Magic
 - Headmaster of Magic: After some test and some good thought, I have come to believe that another dark era is coming...In the past few days, I've been doing a lot of divination, and I've been able to decipher this much: A great, dark, era is coming upon us from the shadows. 
 - Headmaster of Magic: This great darkness has been lurking within us for centuries, and it has finally awoken. However, there is one hope: A great hero will emerge from the depths of hell and the paradise of heaven to save us. That's all I got...every time I try to figure
 - Headmaster of Magic: anything else out, I recieve a strange, dark burn...Must be the work of this dark magic...Please report this unfateful news to the Royal Guardian...
 - Hero reports to Royal Guardian: Really now? A dark era and an emerging Hero, huh? Sounds a bit cliche if you ask me. Nevertheless, we must keep going on with life.
 - Royal Guardian: I think you should take care of the Undeads at Dragonshire first, I am afraid that there mights be another raid on the town.
 - Hero goes to Dragonshire and kills the Undeads
 - Hero meets the villager and told him of the news
 - Villager: Oh no! What should we do now? I think you need to talk to the Great Father Of Adris to learn more about this. He should be in the Castle OF Adris
 - Hero goes to the Castle Of Adris and met the Great Father on the throne
 - Great Father: Another dark age? Oh no! I was just lucky to survive the last dark age 3000 years ago!
 - Great Father: 3000 years ago, a dark lord has risen. He was just a graduate from the School Of Magic then, but he had augmented himself with dark magic...
 - Great Father: He used dark magic to allow undead to rise, angry creatures to attack, he tore the Kingdom Of Galekin to bits with his magic
 - Great Father: We managed to use all the magic our archmages have, and banished him from this world, but not before his magic killed the King Of Galekin
 - Great Father: I saw him when he was banished, he was a giant three headed skeleton that could shoot his skulls and cause huge damage!
 - Great Father: He was the Sepulchure Of The Dark Age, and had destroyed our previous Kingdom. Even now, undeads rise from the grave!
 - Great Father: If he had managed to rise again, we are all doomed...
 - Hero reports back to the Royal Guardian.
 - Royal Guardian: I have thought of that, and I had a discussion with the King, he said that we could find the Staff Of Heavens, the staff used by the archmage to banish the Sepulchure, there may be a chance of the Kingdom's survival. However, we need to prepare before we can attempt to retrieve this item...
 - Royal Guardian: Firstly, I need you to go to the local blacksmith and repair my Sword for me. Here is some gold, it should be enough. He should ask more than just soem gold though.
 - Hero recieves some Gold
 - Hero goes to local blacksmith
 - Blacksmith: Ah! Hello, young man! What brings you here, to my fine shop?
 - Hero: I must have my weapon repaired, I have some gold, is that enough?
 - Blacksmith: You mean this Great Sword of the Royal Guardian? How did you get it!?
 - Hero: I was sent by the Royal Guardian to repair it, if you don't belief, you could ask him yourself.
 - Blacksmith: I am afraid I cannot do it with only the resources I have, you need to deliver some rare resources to me to repair it.
 - Hero: I guess I have to, what do you need?
 - Blacksmith: I need 3 Gems Of Strength, 8 Arcane Gold Ingots, and a Hexigonal Stone. You should go to the dungeons west of here, you could get some good loot and find these resources.
 - Hero: Sounds very difficult, but I would try anyways.
 - Hero finds the Jungle Of Venom, and gained the Hexigonal Stone (Opponents: Venom Spider, Jungle Spider, Venom Spitter, Arachnidis and the boss Queen Spider)

 - Royal Guardian: Really? Haha, I hope you whooped him hard.
 - Royal Guardian: Also, one more thing before we head off, I need some new armor. Go to the royal armory and buy an iron chestplate with protection 2. Use the money I gave you earlier.
 - Hero goes to royal armory.

Guide: How to add Quests

Quests Objectives:
 - Killing mobs (Special Mobs, like Undead Knight, Dragon Rider, Sepulchure, Ravenshire Mage etc)
 - Item delivery (Giving items to NPC)
  - Get item from killing
  - Get item from crafting
  - Get item from exploring (Loot chests)
  - Get item from purchasing
 - Going to location
  - To talk to other NPCs
  - To explore
  - To scout out a location
There are 3 main objectives, with sub- objectives, make sure there are almost equal amount of objectives for each stage, make it balanced, like there would be less location objectives and more killing objectives.
These are only the main goals, there would be obstacles in the way like parkour, dungeon, mobs. Make sure you add that, don't that things too hard.

Every quest need 4 components, a event, location, conversation, and characters. Here is an example:
 - Xephos went to school and met his pet Enderman (Location)
 - Xephos: Hello Enderman, could you teleport me home? (Conversation)
 - Enderman: Of course? Hold my hand. (Conversation)
 - Xephos held the Enderman's hand and teleported home. (Event)
 (Characters and introduced throughout the quest)
So that is an example, now follow this format for every quest.
