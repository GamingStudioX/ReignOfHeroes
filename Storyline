Reign Of Heroes MMORPG Storyline

GamingStudioX, Xephos and Random_Wookie, please complete the storyline and add your ideas please.
What we need to do is to crate an extremely elaborated storyline with names, conversations, locations and actions all stated. If you see anything that could be elaborated, please add on or edit.

 - Archmage: 'Hope the arcane forces be in your favour! The Sorcerers, Wizards, Mages, or whatever you call us. Our speciality is the arcane, the most volatile and powerful force in the universe! We can use powerful spells, from fireballs to teleporting to destroying an entire village!'
 - Assassin: 'Greeting (IGN), we are the Rogues. Stealth is our speciality, and doing the killing blow on our opponents is our weapon. We are the Kingdom's secret weapon, although we raid travellers occasionally, our job is to help the Kingdom alter the history and the Kingdom's fate!'

 - Villager: You have returned so quickly? Ah, you are helping out our reinforcements, good. Thank you so much for your help, if you need anything, ask me! Hey, why don't you go explore the forest west of the town, there have been some strange sightings there...
 - Hero goes to explore the Forest

 - Villager: What?! Undeads? In the - the - the forest? Please! Send word to the Royal Guardian immediately!
 - Hero talks to the Royal Guardian
 - Royal Guardian: Again? Oh, more trouble in the Dragonshire town? Hm. What? Undeads in the forest near the town? This is strange, the Undeads usually reside in graveyards far from the Kingdom...I can't tell what this means, go ask the Headmaster of Magic at his school.
 - Hero goes goes to Headmaster of Magic and relays the Royal Guardian's words
 - Headmaster of Magic: Really? That's absurd...but now that I think of it, things have been a bit different...The temperature has risen and the animals are also acting out of the ordinary...give me some time to think about this, I'm not sure what's going on...
 - After some amount of time, Hero returns to the Headmaster of Magic
 - Headmaster of Magic: After some test and some good thought, I have come to believe that another dark era is coming...In the past few days, I've been doing a lot of divination, and I've been able to decipher this much: A great, dark, era is coming upon us from the shadows. 
 - Headmaster of Magic: This great darkness has been lurking within us for centuries, and it has finally awoken. However, there is one hope: A great hero will emerge from the depths of hell and the paradise of heaven to save us. That's all I got...every time I try to figure
 - Headmaster of Magic: anything else out, I recieve a strange, dark burn...Must be the work of this dark magic...Please report this unfateful news to the Royal Guardian...
 - Hero reports to Royal Guardian: Really now? A dark era and an emerging Hero, huh? Sounds a bit cliche if you ask me. Nevertheless, we must keep going on with life.
 - Royal Guardian: I think you should take care of the Undeads at Dragonshire first, I am afraid that there mights be another raid on the town.
 - Hero goes to Dragonshire and kills the Undeads
 - Hero meets the villager and told him of the news
 - Villager: Oh no! What should we do now? I think you need to talk to the Great Father Of Adris to learn more about this. He should be in the Castle OF Adris
 - Hero goes to the Castle Of Adris and met the Great Father on the throne
 - Great Father: Another dark age? Oh no! I was just lucky to survive the last dark age 3000 years ago!
 - Great Father: 3000 years ago, a dark lord has risen. He was just a graduate from the School Of Magic then, but he had augmented himself with dark magic...
 - Great Father: He used dark magic to allow undead to rise, angry creatures to attack, he tore the Kingdom Of Galekin to bits with his magic
 - Great Father: We managed to use all the magic our archmages have, and banished him from this world, but not before his magic killed the King Of Galekin
 - Great Father: I saw him when he was banished, he was a giant three headed skeleton that could shoot his skulls and cause huge damage!
 - Great Father: He was the Sepulchure Of The Dark Age, and had destroyed our previous Kingdom. Even now, undeads rise from the grave!
 - Great Father: If he had managed to rise again, we are all doomed...

Guide: How to add Quests

Quests Objectives:
 - Killing mobs (Special Mobs, like Undead Knight, Dragon Rider, Sepulchure, Ravenshire Mage etc)
 - Item delivery (Giving items to NPC)
  - Get item from killing
  - Get item from crafting
  - Get item from exploring (Loot chests)
  - Get item from purchasing
 - Going to location
  - To talk to other NPCs
  - To explore
  - To scout out a location
There are 3 main objectives, with sub- objectives, make sure there are almost equal amount of objectives for each stage, make it balanced, like there would be less location objectives and more killing objectives.
These are only the main goals, there would be obstacles in the way like parkour, dungeon, mobs. Make sure you add that, don't that things too hard.

Every quest need 4 components, a event, location, conversation, and characters. Here is an example:
 - Xephos went to school and met his pet Enderman (Location)
 - Xephos: Hello Enderman, could you teleport me home? (Conversation)
 - Enderman: Of course? Hold my hand. (Conversation)
 - Xephos held the Enderman's hand and teleported home. (Event)
 (Characters and introduced throughout the quest)
So that is an example, now follow this format for every quest.
