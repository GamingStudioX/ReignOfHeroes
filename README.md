Reign Of Heroes MMORPG Storyline

GamingStudioX, Xephos and Random_Wookie, please complete the storyline and add your ideas please.
What we need to do is to crate an extremely elaborated storyline with names, conversations, locations and actions all stated. If you see anything that could be elaborated, please add on or edit.

- Stage I
 - Hero is spawned into an area with 8 archmages surrounded, and magic particles around
 - Guide: 'Hero! You are here! Our greatest archmages have summoned you successfully this time! You are needed to save the Kingdom from destruction!'
 - Guide says how Hero is summoned and his purpose
 - Guide gives basic introduction to scenario, and gives quest to go to the ??? (Place where Knights, Mages, Rogues and trained together)
 - Hero finds ??? and completes quest, receiving reward.
   "Depending on the class, the hero is given a quest by his or her teacher/class master. For mage, they might have to      Go to the east side of the castle or training center to the mage center and kill 15 of a certain mob. (Skeleton, as     they are weak at close combat and use bows) and get a certain item from them. Same with the other classes, but with     a different item. Or, each class might have something totally different. Maybe a warrior will have to slay 25           zombies and bring the guardian some items. (rotten flesh for feeding the livestock???) while the assassins will have     to do some sort of parkour, an archery range, kill some criminals, or something else. And mage might have to do         something like work with the (not to be confused with the archmage master) commander to secure a castle wall from       oncoming enemies. From there, they will each meet someone who deems them well in skill and either takes them in as      an apprentice, or is already in their commander from the training camp and will send them one quests and act as         their quest giver for a majority of their time playing." -Xefer
