HeroesAttributesStats

HeroesAttributesStats is an addon for the Heroes plugin. Here is a description:
- Add attributes into the current Heroes plugin.
- The attributes will be:
Strength - For every 1 strength, damage dealt by the player (Normal melee damage) will increase by 3%
Health - For every 1 health, the player's health will increase by 1%
Stamina - For every 1 stamina, the player can sprint for 1 second longer
Intelligence - For every 1 intelligence, the player's mana increase by 3%
Agility - For every 1 agility, the player can move 1 unit (I don't know what is the unit for speed in MC) faster.
Defence - For every 1 defence, the player get 1 unit armor point more
Players can get stats points from gaining vanilla experience, every 3 levels=1 stats points

Heroes: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/heroes/

The info can be stored in a simple data file.

Players can gain stat points by gaining levels.

When a player have stats points, he can use a command to add them to his attributes bank

/stats - View your attributes
/stats points - - View total stats point
/stats add (Attribute) - Add 1 point to attribute

I ripped this off my bukkit.org post, hopefully would be enough information. I assume you have enough knowledge about the Heroes plugin. Thanks!
