Xephos and whoever else doing this, just think of basic skills and add them to the classes.
Each starter class (Squire, Alchemist, Rogue) have 9 skills, secondary class (Knight, Wizard, Renegade) have 13 new skills, and the final class have 8 new skills.
Special classes are same rank as secondary classes but they only get 8 new skills, will be updated soon.
Remember skills from previous classes are carried over.
Make sure the skills are ranked, so they get better and better. Secondary classes' first skill is better than primary lasses' last skill.
Just give us simple and classic skill names. Eg. Slash, Fireball, Assassinate, Cleave, Heal, FireArrow.
No complicated names, just simple everyday words easy to understand, and simple skill actions. (Some are too complicated to make!)
Make the skills balanced, get equal amount of Active skills and Passive skills, also make the amount of skills in different orientation balanced
Eg. 1/3 offensive, 1/3 defensive and 1/3 speed (Of course, Different class orientation gets better or worse skills)
Knight category is defense, Wizard category is offense, and Rogue is speed

Try it first, maybe you can get skills from famous and simple RPG games, games like LoL and WoW have too complicated skills, don't use those that involve too many percentages.
